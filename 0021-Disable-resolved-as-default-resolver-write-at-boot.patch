Subject: [PATCH 21/41] Disable resolved as default resolver, write at boot

Write the resolv.conf at boot immediately.

Let docker, etc, use the direct nameserver information in
/etc/resolv.conf, instead of redirecting to the stub resolver in
systemd-resolved. The stub resolver fails on CNAME resolution and
breaks various applications.
